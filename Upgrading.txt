This file contains instructions for upgrading your FLOW3 1.0 installation
to FLOW3 1.1.

PASSWORD HASHING
----------------

The hashing strategy for password went from salted MD5 over PBKDF2 to Bcrypt.
Plus it is now possible to use a mix of password hashing strategies, as the
used strategy is stored in the credentialsSource of an Account.

That means: make sure your default strategy setting matches the used strategy
for any accounts created before the related changes:
